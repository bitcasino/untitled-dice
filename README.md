Untitled Dice is a bare-bones bitcoin dice casino built on top of the [Moneypot.com gambling API](https://www.moneypot.com/api-docs.html) that lets anyone run their own dice site by forking this project.

Since Moneypot handles the user accounts, betting, faucet, and chat, Untitled Dice does not need a server of its own. It's fully client-side (just some javascript files), so it can be hosted anywhere including Github.

Moneypot even handles the bankroll. Profits are split between you, Moneypot, and Moneypot's investors. See: <https://www.moneypot.com/investment>.
